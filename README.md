My first repository on GitHub
I'm the leader of an Arma 3 milsim community titled the 137th Guards Airborne Regiment of the 106th Guards Tula Airborne Division. The reason why I've created a GitHub account is related to the mods that we have on our server and their acquisition, maintenance, and addition to them.
